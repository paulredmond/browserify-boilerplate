Browserify Boilerplate
======================

My ideal browserify workflow setup. Meant as a reference more than a usable package. Think of it as my sandbox for perfecting Browserify and playing with transformations, ext.

The libraries used are not necessarily meant as a reusable package, I just chose some of my most commonly used npm packages as a demo.

__Not Meant for Direct Use__.
